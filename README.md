# Asset Depreciation Application

This repository contains a fully-fledged, working VB.NET Asset Depreciation Application that I did in my spare time.This application allows users to evaluate a company’s 
asset’s annual depreciation using the double-declining balance and sum-of-the years’ digit method. 

This application was created by me during the first six months of 2020 for practice purposes.
